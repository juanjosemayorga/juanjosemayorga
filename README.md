🧠 **About me**

I'm a creative and adaptable frontend developer who embraces change and leads with empathy.

Since the early days of AI integration, I’ve treated it as a superpower—using it not just to code faster, but to think better, learn faster, and ship smarter. I build beautiful, functional interfaces with a strong focus on usability, accessibility and clean design.

I’m fluent in both English and Spanish, and I thrive in international, collaborative environments.
